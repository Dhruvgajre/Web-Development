# Web-Development

Hi!

I am a third year electronics and telecommunications student trying to get into web development. I have been doing the complete Web Developer Course 2.0 by Rob Perceival and have complete all these projects that are included in the course.
I'm making this repository to create a portfolio of all my projects from the course. 
Feel free to check them out.
Thank You!
